# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in order to create a website that shares information about UFO sightings. The site contains a header, banner, a relevant article that updates as the page is refreshed, and a data table that can filter based on several criteria.

## Results
The inital code was updated to include multiple forms of criteria that users can use to filter the data. As seen in the index.html below, we added criteria to filter for the date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting. The filters can be used together or utilized one at a time to pinpoint specific data.

Additionally, the JavaScript underwent multiple revisions to ensure that the site would be be able to utilize the expanded filters. The filters are case-sensitive, so users need to type their criteria in lowercase to ensure that they recieve their results. Users can also view all of the available data if they have not entered search criteria, and use this information to determine which variables they would like to control. 

Looking below, we can see that only two of the five filters are filled in, the rest are filled with the greyed out placeholder. This allows the user to find personalized information to learn more about recorded UFO sightings.

## Summary
The project allowed us to utilize JavaScript and HTML to create a visually interesting, interactive website. The files can easily be expanded to include more information about UFO sightings, and more data can be added to the table to increase the amount of results.

### Drawbacks and Recommendations 
Although the website has several features that create visual interest and provide helpful information, the dataset is limited, and the filters require an exact match to the formatting of the data. If a user capitalizes a city name, the filter will not pull up the city. This can be updated so an exact match is not necessary, and it becomes more user-friendly. 
Additionally, the website can grow to include a slideshow of UFO sightings that increase visual interest and provide context to the "shape" table filter. Overall, the site sets the foundation for a very strong website that can grow from this version.
